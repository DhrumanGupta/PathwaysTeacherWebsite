    "Name": "Founders Day",
    "Description": "Founder's Day is a musical that is performed each year by the Secondary School and Primary School respectively.<br><br>Since Founder's Day is a musical performance, it required a lot of preparation starting from interviews to practicing and/or making props among other things. Since this is a huge undertaking, a lot of lessons are used to do it.  It reduces the time students get to study by a lot. It takes 3-4 weeks to prepare for, and the time spent each day increases as the event approaches.<br><br>The school goes into evening rehearsals during the last week of preparation, and all participating grades go into full practice, and no study.",
