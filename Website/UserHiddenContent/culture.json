    "Description": "Our environment is one where students are encouraged to be more interactive with teachers. They are taught to ask questions and clear their doubts on the spot. As our motto follows, we not only focus on education, we try to create a good balance in academics, physical activities and extracurriculars. The balance shifted radically during major events, giving more priority to the approaching event.",

    "Title": "How is it Different?",
    "Description": "The school has a friendly and respectful environment where a lot of formal customs are removed. These include but are not limited to: standing up and greeting the teacher together as a class, asking freely for extra time to clear doubts and in general, having a more casual and friendly, yet respecting relationship with students. Students are encouraged to be more independent learners, who are able to learn facts, information and think without constant involvement from the teacher.",

    "Title": "What to Expect",
    "Description": "As a teacher, a very different environment is expected. One where more freedom in terms of methods of teaching is encouraged. Usually, students approach teachers freely to ask questions, get help, schedule extra classes and get feedback. You are their friendly mentors, and you guide them in terms of subject matters and school topics.",
